## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic usage (processes all new products)
python3 shopify_feed_generator.py

# Process specific rows with a custom output file
python3 shopify_feed_generator.py --rows 14786-14812 --output custom_output.xlsx

# Run in test mode with default rows
python3 shopify_feed_generator.py --test

# Show version information
python3 shopify_feed_generator.py --version
```

### Web Interface (Streamlit App)

For a more user-friendly experience, you can use the Streamlit web app:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```

The web interface provides two methods for generating Shopify feeds:

#### Method 1: File Upload
- Upload your MASTER COPY.xlsx file
- Select row ranges visually
- Preview products before generating
- Generate and download the Shopify feed with a simple click

#### Method 2: Manual Input
- Enter product data manually using the same structure as the Excel file
- Input rows with: Description, Size, SKU, Price, Finish Code, Finish Count
- Uses the exact same processing logic as the file upload method
- Supports finish codes: `##` (14 finishes), `x##` (8 finishes), or specific codes
- Perfect for users who would normally enter data into the Excel file

## Features

- **Two input methods**: File upload or manual data entry
- Generates Shopify product feed from MASTER COPY Excel file
- **Manual product creation**: Enter product data through web forms
- **Finish selection**: Choose from 25 available finishes including:
  - Factory Finished Satin Brass (FFSB)
  - Factory Finished Polished Nickel (FFPN)
  - Factory Finished Matt Bronze (FFMB)
  - And 20 more finish options
- **Finishes tracking and reporting**: Automatically identifies products with unidentified finishes
- Correctly handles multiple products with different variants
- Properly prioritizes finishes based on product names (e.g., Cadiz)
- Supports custom row selection for targeted processing
- Handles finish codes (##, x##) for product variants
- Produces properly formatted Excel output ready for Shopify import
- **Dual-tab interface**: File upload and manual input don't interfere with each other

## Finishes Tracking

The system automatically tracks products where finishes couldn't be identified and had to default to using all 25 finishes. This helps with retrospective fixing and quality control.

### Features:
- **Automatic Detection**: Identifies products with unknown finish codes
- **CSV Export**: Creates `finishes_not_found.csv` with detailed information when issues are found
- **Streamlit Integration**: Shows warnings and downloadable reports in the web app
- **Console Feedback**: Clear success/warning messages in command line

### Output Information:
When products with unidentified finishes are found, the system exports a CSV containing:
- Product Description
- Row Index
- Size & SKU
- Finish Code that couldn't be identified
- Reason for defaulting
- What it defaulted to (e.g., "25 finishes from column 25")

### Example Output:
```bash
‚úÖ All products had identifiable finishes
# OR
‚ö†Ô∏è Found 3 products with unidentified finishes
üìÑ Details exported to finishes_not_found.csv
```

## Manual Input Structure

When using the manual input method, you enter data row by row as it would appear in the Excel file:

### Row Fields
- **Description**: Product name (same for all sizes of one product)
- **Size**: Size description (e.g., "32mm x 32mm p")
- **SKU/Code**: Product SKU (e.g., "35607/1")
- **Price**: Retail price in GBP
- **Finish Code**: Finish specification:
  - `##` = Applies to 14 standard finishes
  - `x##` = Applies to 8 premium finishes
  - Specific codes like `FFSB`, `FFPN` = Applies to that specific finish only
  - Empty = Uses all available finishes
- **Finish Count**: Optional number for product-specific finish detection

### Example
For a Cadiz knob with 2 sizes, you would enter 2 rows:
1. Cadiz Raised Circular Cupboard Knob | 32mm x 32mm p | 35607/1 | 18.55 | ## | 8
2. Cadiz Raised Circular Cupboard Knob | 38mm x 32mm p | 35607/2 | 20.58 | ## | 8

This generates 16 variants (2 sizes √ó 8 finishes) using the same logic as the file upload method.

## Latest Version

Version 1.9.0 includes:
- **Products without sizes are now fully supported**: Previously, products without size data were excluded from processing. Now they are included in the Shopify feed with smart option handling.
- **Flexible product structure**: Products without sizes use "Finish" as Option1, while products with sizes continue to use the existing Size/Finish structure.
- **Increased product coverage**: No products are lost due to missing size data, improving feed completeness.
- **Enhanced processing logic**: Intelligently detects whether products have sizes and processes accordingly.
- All previous features from 1.8.5:
  - **Correct SKU mapping for product finishes**: Each finish (CP, SCP, PB, ##, X##) is now correctly mapped to its specific SKU from the MASTER COPY
  - **Fixed case sensitivity issue** with X## vs x## finish codes
  - **Error tracking and reporting** for products that couldn't be processed due to missing data
  - **Products with missing data** are now logged to products_not_processed.csv
  - **Improved Streamlit UI** with proper display of error reports and downloadable CSV
  - **Image Alt Text optimization** for better SEO and accessibility
  - **Generalization improvements** with removal of company-specific references
- All features from 1.7.1:
  - Finishes tracking and reporting for unidentified finishes
  - Enhanced column F logic for better finish selection
  - CSV export functionality for retrospective fixing
  - 25 predefined finishes with proper naming conventions
  - Multiple product support with correct separation
  - Finish prioritization based on product name and finish count
  - Accurate Excel row detection using openpyxl
