Testing & Feedback
Iteration 1:
- Column headers all in place
- for the two rows from MASTER COPY, i expected 16 rows to be generated since there are 8 finishes (shown by the number 8 in column i in the top row) and 2 sizes (two rows) - fix this for iteration 2

Iteration 2 (all fixed):
- Published Column must read "TRUE", not "1" - same for other columns that should be TRUE are coming out as 1
- Price is not being set correctly, it set the same price for all rows, but the price should relate to the size and the finish

Iteration 3:
- trying it with bigger sample set of products (14770-14774, 5 product codes, 25 finishes)
- wasn't using the right row references so wasn't creating the right number of rows, now fixed
- now finds the right SKU and prices for each row

Iteraction 4:
- change variant inventory policy to "deny"
- new row based on new sizes only
