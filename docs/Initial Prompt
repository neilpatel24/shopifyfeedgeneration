I need help creating a Shopify product feed from an excel tab that gets populated from the team with new products to be added.
Everything we’ll need is in the MASTER COPY.xlsx file. 
The ‘MASTER COPY’ tab is the tab where the new products get added.
The way it works is that a new product gets added, with different sizes and different finishes. So for each new product, we need to ensure a row is added to the feed for each size and each finish. 
So if a new product is added with 2 sizes and 8 finishes, it will have 2 rows in the ‘MASTER COPY’ tab, but will need to be represented as 16 new rows in the shopify feed to ensure each variant is included.
An example can be found in rows 14786 and 14787, where the output would look like the product feed in the ‘Sample’ tab. 
I have also included detailed instructions on how to ensure all the columns in the shopify feed are correctly added in the ‘Mapping’ tab.
Can you build a script that will do this exercise for me. Do not try to run the script on the entire MASTER COPY tab at any point. If you ever need to to a test run try it on the products found in rows 14786 and 14787.
